# Pymongo
Mongo DB is a document-oriented multiplatform database program

I have made a bash script that helps to setup mongodb on debian distros eg Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Mint....

To setup run
```bash
sudo chmod u+x ./mongo-installer.sh
sudo ./mongo-installer.sh
```

Open ```index.py``` in you favourite editor
These are just the basics of getting started  with pymongo. Find more from  [The Official Documentation](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/)

Happy Coding!!!!!
